This repository contains my implementations of various SQLite exercises from the Exercism learning platform. Each directory represents a different exercise with its solution and tests.

## Repository Structure

- **`hello-world/`**: First introductory exercise to get familiar with the SQLite track
- **`resistor-color/`**: Exercise implementing the resistor color code calculation
- **`resistor-color-duo/`**: Extended resistor color code exercise working with two color bands
